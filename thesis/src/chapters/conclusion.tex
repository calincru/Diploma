\chapter{Conclusion}

\paragraph{Summary.}

\paragraph{Future work.}
Because our efforts were targeted at having a feature-full implementation that
can take a real world iptables deployment and return a SEFL model, there is
still room for optimization in terms of the generated SEFL code.  One key
observation is that most of the verification time is spent in the underlying
satisfiability solver.  It is the main source of memory consumption too.
Therefore, fine-tuning our code to generate only the needed conditions on each
execution path (or as close to that as possible) can dramatically speed up
symbolic execution.  However, this is by itself a very hard problem considering
the involved semantics of some iptables rules.

In addition to that, further integration testing needs to be performed.  In
this thesis, we limited our tests mostly to synthetic rules which might miss
certain practices that are common in real deployments.  Nevertheless, this is
just a small part of a larger project that aims to build a provably correct
model of an OpenStack deployment and have it verified with SymNet.  Therefore,
integrating it with the other networking components used as part of Neutron
(e.g. Open vSwitch) will be the immediate follow-up challenge.
