\section{Acceptance tests}

Things to say:
* remind about model-real system equivalence problem
* we cannot achieve that, but we want to ensure that all features that we do
support are implemented and behave as expected.

* make sure that its clear what 'acceptance tests' are.
* we performed extensive unit and integration testing which has boosted our
productivity by making it easy to refactor, etc.  The code coverage is
currently 91\% and it is almost as much as it can get.  This means that we do
pass through our tool's code at least one time; however, that should not be
confused with the generated code coverage, and that is why we perform as many
acceptance tests as possible.

* the following is a non-exhaustive and in no particular order list of
scenarios that we want to ensure that work as expected: blabla

\section{Performance tests}
Things to say:
* framework used, benchmark, etc
